# Todo List Application

A simple yet powerful application for managing your tasks efficiently.

## Overview

The Todo List application is a task management solution designed to help users organize and track their tasks. It provides an intuitive interface for creating, updating, and managing tasks with various features like categories, priorities, due dates, and more.

## Project Philosophy

Our approach emphasizes:

- **Quality over quantity**: We prioritize fewer, well-implemented features over many partial implementations
- **Simple solutions**: We prefer straightforward, maintainable code over complex solutions
- **Thorough testing**: Automated tests to prevent regressions and ensure reliability
- **User-centered design**: All technical decisions prioritize the user experience
