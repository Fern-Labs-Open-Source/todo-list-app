## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **User-Centered Design**: Always prioritize user experience in technical decisions
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones when possible
3. **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to understand, modify, and debug
4. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and resource efficiency
5. **Reliability**: Build systems that are robust and handle errors gracefully
6. **Testability**: Design components to be easily testable

### Architectural Approach
- Follow a **component-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- Implement **clean architecture** principles to separate business logic from implementation details
- Use **domain-driven design** for complex business rules
- Design for **horizontal scalability** from the beginning

## Code Organization

### Frontend Structure
```
/src
  /assets         # Static files like images, fonts
  /components     # Reusable UI components
    /common       # Generic components (Button, Input, etc.)
    /layout       # Layout-related components
    /features     # Feature-specific components
  /hooks          # Custom React hooks
  /pages          # Page components
  /routes         # Routing configuration
  /services       # API communication and other services
  /store          # State management (Redux)
    /slices       # Redux slices for features
    /middleware   # Redux middleware
  /styles         # Global styles and themes
  /types          # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils          # Utility functions
```

### Backend Structure
```
/src
  /api            # API routes and controllers
    /v1           # API version 1
  /config         # Configuration files
  /middleware     # Express middleware
  /models         # Database models
  /services       # Business logic services
  /utils          # Utility functions
  /validation     # Input validation schemas
```

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
1. **Branch naming convention**: 
   - Feature: `feature/short-description`
   - Bug fix: `fix/issue-description`
   - Refactor: `refactor/component-name`
   - Documentation: `docs/description`

2. **Commit messages**:
   - Follow conventional commits format: `type(scope): description`
   - Example: `feat(tasks): add recurring task functionality`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

3. **Pull Request Process**:
   - Create a branch from `main`
   - Implement changes with proper tests
   - Submit PR with detailed description
   - Require at least one code review
   - Ensure CI checks pass
   - Squash and merge to maintain clean history

### Release Process
1. **Versioning**:
   - Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
   - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
   - Automate version bumping with CI

2. **Release Cadence**:
   - Regular releases every 2 weeks
   - Critical bug fixes as needed

3. **Change Documentation**:
   - Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file
   - Document all significant changes

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Limit nesting to maximum 3 levels deep
- Use early returns to reduce complexity
- Avoid magic numbers and strings

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Avoid any type when possible in TypeScript
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing

### CSS/Styling Standards
- Use CSS-in-JS with styled-components
- Follow a component-oriented styling approach
- Implement design tokens for consistency
- Use responsive design principles throughout
- Follow BEM naming convention for any global CSS

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: 70% coverage
  - Test individual components and functions
  - Fast execution for quick feedback
  - Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript code

- **Integration Tests**: 20% coverage
  - Test interaction between components
  - Focus on API integrations and data flow
  - Use React Testing Library for frontend

- **End-to-End Tests**: 10% coverage
  - Test complete user flows
  - Simulate real user behavior
  - Use Cypress for E2E testing

### Testing Best Practices
- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD where appropriate)
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Implement snapshot testing sparingly
- Mock external dependencies

### Code Coverage
- Aim for at least 80% total code coverage
- Enforce via CI/CD pipeline
- Focus on critical paths for 100% coverage

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
- Run on every pull request and merge to main
- Automated build process
- Run linting and code style checks
- Execute all automated tests
- Generate code coverage reports
- Perform static code analysis

### Continuous Deployment
- Automated deployment to development environment
- Manual approval for staging and production
- Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Post-deployment health checks

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation
- Document public API methods with JSDoc
- Add comments for complex logic or algorithms
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Document known limitations and edge cases

### Technical Documentation
- Maintain architecture diagrams
- Document integration points
- Create onboarding guide for new developers
- Document configuration options

### User Documentation
- Create user guides for key features
- Include screenshots and examples
- Keep documentation versioned alongside code

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Performance
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Optimize images and assets
- Use performance monitoring tools

### Backend Performance
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and indexes
- Use connection pooling
- Implement rate limiting
- Consider using worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks

### Database Optimization
- Create proper indexes for frequent queries
- Implement database-level caching
- Use database migrations for schema changes
- Consider read replicas for scaling

## Security Practices

### Frontend Security
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Use HttpOnly cookies for sensitive data
- Protect against XSS and CSRF attacks
- Follow OWASP recommendations

### Backend Security
- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use security headers
- Rate limit API endpoints

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Implement health check endpoints
- Use APM tools for performance monitoring
- Set up alerts for critical errors
- Monitor key performance metrics

### Logging Strategy
- Use structured logging format
- Include contextual information
- Implement log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Centralize logs with a log management system
- Rotate and archive logs

### Error Tracking
- Implement global error handling
- Track and group similar errors
- Include context with error reports
- Set up notifications for critical errors

## Development Environment Setup

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or Yarn
- MongoDB
- Git

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env`)

### Development Tools
- VSCode as recommended IDE
- ESLint and Prettier extensions
- MongoDB Compass for database management
