# API Directory

This directory contains all API routes and controllers for the Todo List application.

## Structure

- `/v1` - Version 1 of the API
  - Routes are organized by resource (users, tasks, categories, etc.)

## Best Practices

1. Follow RESTful conventions
2. Implement proper input validation
3. Handle errors consistently
4. Document API endpoints with comments
5. Separate route definitions from controller logic
