# Hooks Directory

This directory contains custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable stateful logic.

## Examples

- `useAuth.ts` - Authentication related hooks
- `useTasks.ts` - Task management hooks
- `useForm.ts` - Form handling hooks
- `useLocalStorage.ts` - Local storage interaction

## Best Practices

1. Each hook should focus on a single concern
2. Hooks should be well-tested
3. Add TypeScript types for inputs and outputs
4. Include usage examples in comments
