# Services Directory

This directory contains service modules that handle external communication and business logic.

## Structure

- API communication services
- External integrations
- Complex business logic that doesn't belong in components

## Best Practices

1. Services should be modular and focused
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for request/response types
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Services should be thoroughly tested
