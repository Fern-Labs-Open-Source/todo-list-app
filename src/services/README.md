# Services Directory

This directory contains business logic services that are separate from routes and controllers.

## Services

- `AuthService.js` - Authentication and authorization logic
- `TaskService.js` - Task management logic
- `CategoryService.js` - Category management logic
- `EmailService.js` - Email notification logic

## Best Practices

1. Services should encapsulate complex business logic
2. Keep services focused on specific domains
3. Use dependency injection for better testability
4. Implement proper error handling
